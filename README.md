## Vision
Leveraging inflight time of each and every user in a most meaningful way.

## Inspiration
More than 7 million hours of on air time is not utilized every month and the numbers are increasing at the rate of more than 20% per year.<br>
Travellers want to enjoy their in-flight time in the best way and not just by getting bored.

## What it does
It caters to the need of every type of users so that they can make best use of their in flight time in a way they want.<br>
**1. For persons looking for building their network**<br>
App connects them with other passengers with similar professional interests. They can chat and create new business opportunities.<br>**2. For persons looking for social activities**<br>
They can chat and share with other passengers with similar social interests. Also, they can be a part of some interest groups or create new groups and interact with multiple people.<br>
**3. For persons seeking rest**<br>
Activate the 'Do not disturb' mode and our app will make sure that no one disturbs you.<br>
**4. For entertainment seeking person**<br>
App provides a gaming section where multiple passengers can play and compete.<br>
**5. For others**<br>
There are more facilities in the 'More' section of the app to read books, printer services(if feasible) etc.<br>

## How we built it
We are developing for android using machine learning and flask.<br>
For finding people with mutual corporate or social interests, profile of people created(added at the time of installing the app) is used. Using machine learning, a score is assigned to users on the basis of similarity between their activities, work experiences and where they are going. **The app lets them connect only if both the users are interested.**<br>
Similarly for interest groups, multiple people can join in and chat.<br>
We are using a **status** for each users to indicate if he's busy, available, away or on do not disturb mode.
For **rest**, do not disturb mode is activated.<br>
For games, a common score board is displayed.<br>

## Challenges we ran into
Main challenges were:<br>
1. How to keep users engage and not letting them drift away.<br>
2. How to cater needs of diverse range of personas.<br>
3. Effectively matching the interests of passengers travelling.<br>
4. How to ensure not to overwhelm a person.<br>

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
1. Able to make optimal use of inflight time for all spectrum of personas.
2. Leading to more satisfied customer base.

## Monetary points for Vistara?
1. More satisfied customers -> More booking through Vistara -> More revenue.<br>
2. Vistara points on games ultimately leading to more Vistara bookings(Club Vistara).

## What's next for AirTime
1. Expanding to utilization of on airport time in a similar manner to provide seamless experience.<br>
2. Involving airport services in it.<br>
3. Supporting augmented and virtual reality in some way.<br>
